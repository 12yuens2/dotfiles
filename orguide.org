* Org-mode
Org-mode files are structures like LateX files with headings and subheadings. We use a * to indicate a heading.

** Subheading
Multiple ** creates subheadings and further.

*** Here's a sub-subheading
Created with ***

** Navigation
Each heading can be minimised and expanded by hovering on the heading and pressing TAB. Shift-TAB closes and expands all headings in the document. Use C-c C-j and C-c C-k (Defaults in Org are C-c C-n and C-c C-p but I've changed the bindings) to jump forward and backwards along the headings.
